# DSA Lab Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) assignments implemented in C++/Python. Each program demonstrates fundamental concepts of data structures such as trees, graphs, searching, sorting, and file handling.

## Table of Contents

1. **Implementing a Hash Table**
   - Implements a hash table with collision handling techniques like chaining or open addressing.

2. **Set Operations using ADT**
   - Creates an Abstract Data Type (ADT) that supports union, intersection, and difference operations on sets.

3. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation**
   - Constructs a BST and provides functions to insert, delete, and search for a key element.

4. **Expression Tree Creation**
   - Builds an expression tree from a given prefix, infix, or postfix expression and evaluates it.

5. **Convert a Binary Tree into a Threaded Binary Tree**
   - Implements a threaded binary tree to facilitate efficient in-order traversal without recursion.

6. **Graph Traversal - BFS and DFS**
   - Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms for graph traversal.

7. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) - Prim's & Kruskal's Algorithm**
   - Implements Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph.

8. **Shell Sort Algorithm**
   - Implements the Shell Sort algorithm for sorting an array.

9. **Merge Sort Algorithm**
   - Implements the Merge Sort algorithm for sorting an array.

10. **File Handling Operations**
   - Demonstrates file handling operations such as reading from and writing to files.

11. **Study of Optimal Binary Search Trees (OBST)**
   - Theoretical study on constructing an optimal binary search tree to minimize search time.

12. **Study of AVL Trees**
   - Theoretical study on AVL trees, their rotations, and balancing mechanisms.
